University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore THE UNIVERSITY Though this institution received its charter as a University in the year 1961, it has a much longer history as a distinguished seat of learning in engineering sciences. The institute started its operation in 1921 as the Mughalpura Technical College, deriving its name from the famous suburb of the old city of Lahore, richly dotted with architectural heritage of the great Mughals including the magnificent Shalimar Gardens. Its more familiar name of the pre-University era, the Maclagan Engineering College, was given to it in 1923 when Sir Edwards Maclagan, the then Governor of the Punjab, laid the foundation stone of the building, now called the Main Block, which still retains its majesty in spite of the wear and tear of almost a century. At that time, the institution offered courses of study in two disciplines, namely Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. The year 1932 is a major milestone in the evolution of this institution when it was affiliated with the University of the Punjab for award of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. At the time of Independence, i.e., in 1947, it had well-established B.Sc. degree courses in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, and the quality of its scholastic standards won it a place of prestige throughout the British India.

In 1954, it started a Bachelor's degree course in Mining Engineering, the first-ever of its kind in the country. But its massive expansion and development commenced in 1961 on its transformation into a University. It set for itself a variety of goals, but the first priority was to start teaching of those disciplines, which were crucial for national development but were not catered for by any institution in the country. Accordingly, in the sixties, Bachelor's degree courses were started in Chemical Engineering, Petroleum & Gas Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Architecture, and City & Regional Planning.

Later, the University concentrated its energies and resources on developing its postgraduate programs. By 1970's it had established over a score of Master's degree courses in diverse specializations of engineering, architecture, planning and allied disciplines. Ph.D. degree program was also instituted in a number of disciplines. The process of consolidating and strengthening continued to be a major concern of the University, with phenomenal increase in student's enrolment in seventies. Consequently, the University College of Engineering was established in 1975 at Sahiwal. For three years it functioned at Sahiwal and was shifted to its present campus at Taxila in 1978. Subsequently, this college was upgraded to a university and it is currently functioning as University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila.
**************************************************
Establishing traditions of research in the engineering and allied disciplines has been a major goal of the University. With this end in view, the University established a Directorate of Research, Extension and Advisory Services, now called Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC), which strives for the promotion and organization of research activities.

In the recent past, there has been a substantial rise in students' enrolment and the figure has now gone up to over 13,163. Currently, 2,527 students are pursuing postgraduate studies. The number of female students enrolling for different disciplines is ever on the increase and is 3,462 at present. The number of foreign students coming from countries, like Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Kenya, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Bangladesh, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka is over 479 which gives the University Campus a cosmopolitan character.

The university has 766 teachers of which 382 have a Ph.D. degree, whereas 101 are pursuing Ph.D. abroad.

The teaching departments of the University are grouped into the following seven faculties:

• • • • • •

—

Faculty of Electrical Engineering Faculty of Mechanical Engineering Faculty of Civil Engineering Faculty of Architecture & Planning Faculty of Chemical, Metallurgical and Polymer Engineering Faculty of Natural Sciences, Humanities and Islamic Studies Faculty of Earth Sciences and Engineering

The university set up a campus at Faisalabad in 2006 and also established a campus at Kala Shah Kaku in 2007, which is known as University’s City Campus. Rachna College of Engineering & Technology, Gujranwala is a constituent college and follows the same academic curriculum and policies as the ones followed at the main campus in Lahore. In 2012, the university established a new campus in Narowal with an aim to produce quality technical manpower for the District of Narowal and its surroundings. In addition to managing its own campus, the University controls the academic programs and examinations of numerous institutions, which are affiliated with it for award of degrees.

Then on the basis of the percentage admission marks, comparative merit of the applicants in the group is prepared. The applicants belonging to a category thus compete for admission amongst themselves for the seats allocated to it.

8. TRANSFER ON THE BASIS OF GIVEN PREFERENCES AND MERIT

In case a seat in any discipline/category of applicant’s higher preference falls vacant and he is eligible for transfer to that discipline/category on the basis of his merit, he shall be automatically transferred to the discipline/category.
**************************************************
9. VARIATION IN SEATS

The University authorities may exercise their right at any time to increase or decrease the number of seats allocated to any category and there shall be no appeal against such a decision.

10. UN-UTILIZED SEATS

If some seats allocated to any category (other than Open Merit) remain un-utilized for lack of adequate applicants, then the un-utilized seats are transferred to Punjab domiciled Open Merit category and are filled under the same terms and conditions as applicable to the former.

The curricula in the University include compulsory and optional subjects. Islamic & Pakistan studies are included in the compulsory subjects. The underlying purpose of teaching this subject to the students of engineering disciplines is to impress upon them the richness of Islamic culture, heritage and civilization and the role played by Islamic ideology in guiding the Muslims of the sub-continent towards their most cherished goal of an independent home land, Pakistan. After inculcating in them the Cultural, Social, Economic, Political and historical aspects of Islamic civilization, the students would be able to protect and promote Islam, not only as a religion but as a system in Pakistan and in the world as well. For the realization of these objectives, the Islamic Studies was introduced in the University as an optional subject in 1961. In the subsequent years, due to its importance this subject was made compulsory for all the Muslim students and its scope was progressively enlarged. Now the Department teaches Islamic Studies to all undergraduate programs. In 1982 the Government of Pakistan prescribed Pakistan Studies as an essential component of the syllabi at all levels of education. Since then the Department is teaching this subject also. The University welcomed the idea of the Governor of Punjab to teach Qur'anic translation to the students of bachelor's degree programs. So the subject "Translation of the Holy Qur'an", one credit hour course per year, is being taught to the undergraduate students since 2020. The Department has a computer lab and a library rich with high quality research books. In addition to all these activities, some faculty members of the Department have been delivering Friday Sermon in Jamia Mosque UET.

𝑛

𝑛

𝐺𝑃𝐴 = ∑(𝐺𝑃𝑖 × 𝐶𝐻𝑖) ∑ 𝐶𝐻𝑖 𝑖=1 where n is the number of subjects in the semester for which GPA is being computed. 𝑚 ⁄ 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝐶𝐺𝑃𝐴 = ∑(𝐺𝑃𝑖 × 𝐶𝐻𝑖) 𝑖=1 ⁄ ∑ 𝐶𝐻𝑖 𝑖=1

𝑖=1

where m is the number of total subjects covered in all semesters up to the semester for which CGPA is to be computed.

11.2 Authority to Compute Results

Grade Points (GP) in each subject, Semester Grade Point Average and Cumulative Grade Point Average of each student shall be computed and notified by the Controller of Examinations at the end of each semester.

12.0 Award of "W" , "WF", “I” and "IP" Grades

Applications (Form 1) to withdraw from a subject shall be entertained latest up to the 6th study week during fall and spring semesters and up to 3rd study week during summer semester. Withdrawn subjects shall appear in the transcript with a letter grade "W” and shall not be used in computation of GPA. In the transcript, subjects repeated after withdrawal will not be suffixed with a "R". If a student withdraws from a subject, which he is repeating, the previous grade earned will be retained in computation of CGPA and in assessing degree completion requirements.

12.2 Forced Withdrawal (“WF” Grade)

a) A student registered in a subject may not be permitted to continue due to shortage of attendance or other disciplinary action. Such students shall be awarded a Forced Withdrawal (WF) grade. It shall appear in the transcript as such and shall not be used in computation of GPA. Subjects repeated after forced withdrawal will not be suffixed with “R”.

Students having less than 50% attendance will not be eligible for award of this grade. This grade shall appear in the transcript temporarily until it is replaced by the actual grade and will not be treated as an "F" grade. The student receiving such a grade shall make up the unfinished portion of his subject to the satisfaction of the faculty member who awarded this grade, and is given a letter grade as per regulation 10 at the discretion of the faculty member without prejudice to the previous grade "I". In case, the student fails to complete the unfinished portion within the following semester, i.e., spring semester for an “I” grade awarded in fall semester and fall semester for an “I” grade awarded in spring semester, his "I" grade would be converted to an "F" grade by the Controller of Examinations. The responsibility for completing the unfinished portion and satisfying the faculty member lies with the affected student.

12.4 In Progress “IP” Grade

a) Type “C” subjects, like theses, projects, studio work, etc., spread over more than one semester may be graded as "IP" until completion of these subjects. This grade shall be recorded in the transcript and will not be treated as an "F" grade.

b) Each portion of a Type “C” subject spread over two semesters may have been prescribed different nomenclature and different subject code. First portion of such a subject may be graded as “IP” upon completion, if the department decides to award the final letter grade upon completion of the second portion. It shall appear in the transcript as such and shall not be used in computation of GPA. Grades assigned in the semester in which the subjects are completed will be used in computation of Semester GPA with total credit hours of the subjects being counted for this purpose.
